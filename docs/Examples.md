## Custom characters
Here there are some custom characters, some from [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/main/characters/Example.yaml), some from koboldcpp, and some created by me. I noticed that giving to a character some `adjectives`, a `description` and an `example dialogue` works good.

You need to end the sentences of each character in the example dialogue with `\n`.

You can change the format and/or what you put in those fields (`adjectives`, `description`, `example dialogue`, you must keep the `\n` at the end of the character sentence though).

You can find more character examples online.
